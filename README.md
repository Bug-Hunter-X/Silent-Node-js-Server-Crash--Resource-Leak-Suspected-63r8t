# Silent Node.js Server Crash

This repository demonstrates a scenario where a Node.js server crashes silently without providing any error messages in the console.  The likely cause is a resource leak, such as unclosed file handles or database connections.  The provided `server.js` is a minimal example; the actual issue is likely in code managing resources outside of this simple server.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3.  (The error will not be visible in standard output.)  You may need to use system monitoring tools such as `top` or resource monitoring within your IDE to detect the resource exhaustion leading to the crash.
4. Examine `serverSolution.js` for a possible solution if resources are being consumed without proper cleanup.

## Solution

The solution, demonstrated in `serverSolution.js`, focuses on properly handling resources. The exact solution will depend on the specific resources (files, database connections, etc.) and how they're used in your application. This simple example shows a general concept of ensuring closure.
